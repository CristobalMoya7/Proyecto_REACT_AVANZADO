# Walla second hand shop on React

## Local Environment Installation and Execution

### Requirements:
Node v16.14.0

### Cloning the Repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Balexo/react_practica.git`

### Installing Dependencies:
`npm install`

### Application Execution (Default Port 3000):
`npm start`

### Backend Startup:
The backend is based on the implementation in Nestjs developed by David Jim√©nez:

`https://github.com/davidjj76/nodepop-api`

### Once cloned and its dependencies are installed, run:

`npm start`

The backend runs by default on port 3001

### Authenticating a User on the Home Page:

Predefined user:

Username: user@user.com
Password: 1234


## Basic Features:

* Register a new user
* Authenticate a user against the backend
* Keep credentials/accesToken on the user's device
* Create ads with five fields - name, price, sale, tags, photo- (photo fields is not required). Adds are persisted on the backend
* View the list of existing ads
* View the details of an ad
* Search and find ads based on criteria: name, min and max price, and categories
* Delete an ad (after confirmation)
* Log out (after confirmation)

### Notes:
Add filtering is done on the frontend, so searches by filters do not involve additional requests to the backend.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
